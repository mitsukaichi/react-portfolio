- Navigation highlights the current page
- Home page redirects to the About Me page
- Contact page validate the empty field and email address
- Resume pages link to a downloadable resume and developers's skill list
- Footer contains links to GitHub, Linkedin and something else

## Things learnt from this challenge

- View height for the single page application is defined by the longest content of all the child components that can possibly appear on that page. I struggled to set the footer at the bottom of the page while not using `fixed-bottom` class - which overlaps the main content when the main content is longer than the view port. I decided to add `min-height: 75vh;` which will make the footer appear at the bottom of the screen even with the large screen, while not leaving too much space between the bottom of the content and the footer in the pages with shorter content. 
- When react pass props to its child component, it puts all the things passed on to the child componet as a single object. When you pass something already being an object to the child component, you use the object at its child component by putting the object name in double carly brases `{{object_name}}` to directly access to its property.
- When the CSS stylesheet is imported as a package, the imported style sheets are listed at the END of the header in HTML, so if you put your custom stylesheet as a link within index.html, it will be overridden by the imported CSS. You can import your custome stylesheet within your JSX file. Add the import of your custom stylesheet AFTER the non-custom stylesheet to ensure your custom stylesheet overrides other stylesheets.
